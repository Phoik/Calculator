# Calculator
Use Cases:
# - Create functions for the main calulations Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide [DONE]
# - Create function 'operate' that takes in an operator and 2 numbers then calls one of the above functions [DONE]
# - Create basic HTML calc, has numbers/the above functions/clear button [DONE]
- Create function that populates the display when you click the number buttons, store the 'display' value for next step
- Make it work, Store the first number that is input into the calc when a user presses an operator, and also save which operator is chosen. Then run operate using the correct operator when the user presses =
- When operate has been called make sure it populates the display
- You will need to figure out how to store all of the values and call the operate function with them. THIS CAN TAKE A WHILE TO GRASP, so dont feel bad if it takes a while 

Advice
- Round answers using long decimals so they dont overflow the display
- Make sure clear is actually clearing all of the data
